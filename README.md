# Recursion

->use the result of recursion with current step never question that how we got to this.

->always use recursion ,break the problem as soon as possible.solve for 0 ,small and 1 step and break it to smaller

return type functionName(intputs,changing root)
{
    Base Condition//smallest input for recursion or 1 step solve 
    TotalAnswer=presentAnswer+Answer(take step-1)
    some stuff and solving problem(induction)
}
